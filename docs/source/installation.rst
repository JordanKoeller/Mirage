Installing Mirage
=================

The easiest way to get Mirage is to clone from the `github repository <https://github.com/JordanKoeller/Mirage>`_. Then run the command ``bash configure`` from the project directory. This command will use the Python package manager ``pip`` to install all dependencies and compile the project.

Once the setup script has been run, you will be asked if you would like to add ``mirage`` to 
your ``.bashrc`` profile. If you choose yes, you will be able to run ``mirage`` and open a python 
interpreter with the program already imported. Otherwise, you will need to run the ``mirage`` 
script from inside ``scripts/`` to launch the program. For more info on using the program, see 
:doc:`Getting Started with Mirage <gettingstarted>`.
